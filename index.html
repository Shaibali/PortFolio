        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Ariana Grande-Butera (/ˌɑːriˈɑːnə ˈɡrændiː/;[1] born June 26, 1993) is an American singer and actress. She has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, two Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 22 Guinness World Records.

Born in Boca Raton, Florida, Grande began her career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical 13. She rose to fame for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013) and Sam & Cat (2013–2014). She subsequently signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label's executives discovered YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album,[2] Yours Truly (2013), topped the US Billboard 200 chart, while its lead single, "The Way", charted in the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. Upon release, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey for her wide vocal range and whistle register.

Grande maintained her pop and R&B sound on her second and third studio albums, My Everything (2014), and Dangerous Woman (2016), with the former exploring EDM and achieving global success with the singles "Problem", "Break Free" and "Bang Bang", and the latter becoming her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK Albums Chart. Her personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), which were both critical and commercial successes. The former won Grande a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, while the latter broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album, and was nominated for the Album of the Year.[3] The singles "Thank U, Next", "7 Rings", and "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously, and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK. In 2020, her collaborations "Stuck with U" with Justin Bieber and "Rain on Me" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, while the latter won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Grande's R&B-influenced sixth studio album, Positions (2020), and its title track, debuted at number-one in the UK and US. In 2021, Grande was featured on the remix of The Weeknd's "Save Your Tears", which became her sixth number-one in the US.

Grande has earned more than 85 million certified units in the US (studio albums, singles, and collaborations), with all of her studio albums certified platinum or more by the Recording Industry Association of America.[4] She holds several Billboard Hot 100 chart records; among them, she is the only artist to have five number-one debuts, to have their first five number one singles debut at the top spot, to have three number one-debuts in a calendar year, and all lead singles from each of her studio albums debut in the top ten. Having amassed 90 billion consumed streams thus far, Grande is the most streamed female artist ever. She is also the most streamed female artist on Spotify and Apple Music, while being currently the most followed solo female artist on the former, and the most subscribed on YouTube.[5][6][7] She has been included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2016 and 2019) and on Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019 and 2020), while Billboard has honored her as Woman of the Year (2018), the greatest pop star of 2019,[8] and the most accomplished female artist to debut in the 2010s.[9] Aside from music, Grande has used her platform to advocate for gender, racial, and LGBT equality. Furthermore, she has been the most followed woman on Instagram since 2019.</p>
